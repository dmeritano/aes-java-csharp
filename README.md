# AES with C# and Java

Encryption and decryption of text strings using **Advanced Encryption Standard** (AES) algorithm.  

Strings encrypted in **Java** can be decrypted in **C#** and vice versa.

There are two projects (CSharpAES and JavaAES), with unit tests included. 

The first project (CSharpAES) is in Visual Studio 2019 format and the second (JavaAES) is a Java project with Maven, so you can use any IDE or CLI to compile and generate the binaries.
